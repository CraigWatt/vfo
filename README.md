# vfo - Video File Organiser

vfo is a CLI program.  vfo is currently in pre-release, but is in a usable state!  Please reach out to me here if you have any questions.

This C program currently runs on Mac.

Dev is working on making program work & be easily installable on Mac, Linux & eventually Windows

Current release versions are static builds, place both the vfo executable and vfo_config.conf file into your machines $PATH

For Mac this is typically your /usr/local/bin folder

This will then enable the use of vfo in your terminal. e.g. vfo -v

use vfo -h to see list of commands

vfo original
vfo source
vfo *alias*

Please also look inside vfo_config.conf.  Here you can easily customise how you want vfo to run for you!

I'll be providing two companion vidoes in future that 1: explains the basics on how to use this program 2: how the program works (i.e. the programming involved to make vfo)

Thanks,
Craig
