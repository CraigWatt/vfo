# vfo - Video File Organiser

vfo is a CLI program.  vfo is currently in pre-release, but is in a usable state!  Please reach out to me here if you have any quick fire questions: https://github.com/CraigWatt/vfo/discussions/27

This C program currently runs on Mac.

You will likely run into issues installing and running this program on linux and windows in it's current state, rest assured the program will be installable and runnable on these Operating Systems ASAP!

macOS .pkg Installer is now available!  (please shift click to bypass unverified dev popup)
Please refer to Latest Release for additional Installation Options.

This will then enable the use of vfo in your terminal. e.g. vfo -v
use vfo -h to see list of commands

common examples:

vfo original
vfo source
vfo *alias*

Please also look inside vfo_config.conf.  Here you can easily customise how you want vfo to run for you!

I'll be providing two companion vidoes in future that 1: explains the basics on how to use this program 2: how the program works (i.e. the programming involved to make vfo)

Thanks,
Craig
